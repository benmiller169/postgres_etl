Database Purpose and Goals

The purpose of this database is to pull in data from two different sources, clean it and prepare it for analysis.

I have created a fact table called songplays which summariseshttps://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd027/parts/f7dbb125-87a2-4369-bb64-dc5c21bb668a/modules/c0e48224-f2d0-4bf5-ac02-3e1493e530fc/lessons/01995bb4-db30-4e01-bf38-ff11b631be0f/concepts/1533c19b-0505-49fd-b1b7-06c987641f0d all the most important information. 

There a number of dimension tables that connect to this. This load the key information into the songplays table.
