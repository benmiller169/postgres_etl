Database Purpose and Goals

The purpose of this database is to pull in data from two different sources, clean it and prepare it for analysis. 


Justification

I have created a fact table called songplays which summarises all the most important information. 

There a number of dimension tables that connect to this. This load the key information into the songplays table.
